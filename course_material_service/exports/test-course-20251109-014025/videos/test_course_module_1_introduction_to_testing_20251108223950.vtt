[What is Testing?] Testing is a systematic process used to evaluate a product's functionality and performance. Think of it as a way to ensure that what you've created meets expectations. Whether it’s a software application, hardware device, or even a method, testing helps identify flaws before release. It’s crucial for quality assurance and user satisfaction. Have you ever used a product that didn’t work as expected? That's where effective testing comes in.
