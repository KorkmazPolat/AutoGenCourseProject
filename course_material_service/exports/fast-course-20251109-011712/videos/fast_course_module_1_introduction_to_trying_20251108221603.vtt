[Fast Course - Module 1: Introduction to Trying] Are you afraid to try something new? Let's change that!

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:30.430
[Understanding Mindset] To succeed, it’s crucial to adopt a growth mindset. This means believing you can develop your abilities through effort and learning. Think about the last time you tried something new—how did it feel? For instance, learning to ride a bicycle often starts with falls, but each attempt brings you closer to success. Viewing challenges as opportunities is key to personal growth. So, how can you shift your perspective when faced with daunting tasks?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:54.690
[Overcoming Fear of Failure] Fear of failure can be paralyzing, but it’s time to rethink that! Instead of dwelling on the potential for mistakes, consider the lessons they provide. A notable example is Thomas Edison, who famously said he found 10,000 ways that won’t work before inventing the light bulb. What if we viewed failures as stepping stones? Embracing a mindset where mistakes are learning moments can propel us forward.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:20.460
[Embracing Challenges] Challenges should not intimidate us but inspire us! Picture a time you faced something tough but emerged stronger. For instance, training for a marathon can be grueling, yet each run builds both physical and mental endurance. When challenges arise, ask yourself: How can I embrace this? This resilience is vital, not just in personal goals but in a professional setting, too.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:46.830
[Value of Trying] Trying is about more than success; it’s about experience and growth. Every time you attempt something, you’re expanding your comfort zone. Did you know that many successful entrepreneurs failed multiple times before reaching their goals? This illustrates that the value comes from effort, not just outcome. So, what will you try next? Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination!
