[What is Async Programming?] Async programming allows developers to run multiple operations concurrently, enhancing efficiency without requiring threads. Imagine a web server that can handle thousands of requests at once! It eliminates blocking operations that slow down processes. Traditional synchronous code waits for tasks to complete, but with async, tasks can run side-by-side. This is critical for I/O-bound tasks, like web scraping or API calls, where waiting for responses can drastically reduce performance. So, why adapt to async? It fundamentally shifts how we code for better scalability.
