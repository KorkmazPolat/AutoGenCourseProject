[Defining Machine Learning] Machine Learning, or ML, is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the ability of computers to learn from data. For instance, when you use Netflix, its recommendations improve based on your viewing habits; that’s ML in action! Unlike traditional programming, where tasks are explicitly coded, ML algorithms identify patterns and make decisions on their own based on input data. Isn't that fascinating? This adaptive learning leads to better accuracy and efficiency.
