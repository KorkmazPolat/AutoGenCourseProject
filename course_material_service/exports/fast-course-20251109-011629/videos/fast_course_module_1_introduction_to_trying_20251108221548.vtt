[Discover Growth Mindset] A growth mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. For example, consider athletes like Michael Jordan, who failed numerous times but learned and improved through those experiences. Embracing a growth mindset encourages us to try new things without the fear of failing. Have you ever avoided trying simply because you were afraid to fail? It's crucial to recognize that this mindset fosters resilience and a love for learning.
